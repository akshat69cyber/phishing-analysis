#  Phishing Email Analysis

This project contains a simple analysis of a phishing email to identify common threat indicators.  
It was created as part of a cybersecurity task to build awareness of how phishing attacks work.

#  What I Did

* Collected a sample phishing email
* Analyzed the sender's email address for spoofing
* Used an online header analyzer to check SPF/DKIM
* Identified suspicious links and urgency in language
* Verified phishing indicators like:
   Fake domain
   Fear-based message
   Suspicious links (hidden URL paths)

#  Outcome

This helped improve my ability to detect and analyze phishing emails using email header tools and basic cyber awareness techniques.
