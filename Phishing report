# Sender Address Check

The email was sent from a domain that doesn’t belong to the official Microsoft domain. This suggests the sender is trying to impersonate a trusted company.

**Possible spoofed email address**

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# Header Analysis

Using an online email header analyzer, SPF and DKIM information wasn’t clearly shown or didn’t validate. This could mean the email is not verified and may be forged.

**Suspicious header with missing or failed security checks**

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# Suspicious Links or Attachments

The email contains links to reset a password and check account info. These kinds of links are often used in phishing emails to trick users into giving away personal info.

**Likely malicious links**

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# Urgent Language

The message uses urgency by warning that the account may have been compromised. This is a common trick in phishing to make the reader act quickly without thinking.

**Threatening or urgent tone**

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# Mismatched URLs

Not visible in the test, but it’s good practice to always hover over links to check if the real URL matches the visible one. In phishing emails, they often don’t.

**Could be mismatched — not confirmed**

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# Grammar or Spelling Issues

The email didn’t have any major grammar or spelling problems, which is common in more convincing phishing emails nowadays.

**No grammar errors, but still suspicious**
